# Post style guide

## Frontmatter:

`---`
```
title: "There's no divine inspiration in design"
date: "2017-05-14"
featuredImage: "./mountaintop-theres-no-divine-inspiration-in-design-mike-zetlow.jpg"
topic: "user experience"
type: "article"
rating: "580"
draft: false
```
`---`

##Images

Images are named with this convention:

what-it-is-

title-of-post-

mike-zetlow

.jpg

```
![](mountaintop-theres-no-divine-inspiration-in-design-mike-zetlow.jpg)
```

Save the images in .jpg formatâ€”no more than 1920px width and 1080px height. Save with the lowest quality before degradation is visible in the image.

If the image has a caption, wrap it in a `<figcaption>` tag. You can include links in captions.

```

## Headings

The highest heading in a post is `##`. The next highest is `###` and so on.

## File naming

All posts and their related images are saved in a folder named with the title of the post in kebab case.

`everyone-hates-a-redesign`

The `.md` file itself is named `index.md` (for Gatsby's page creation purposes).

See [Images](##Images) for naming of image files.

**Kebab case is used for filenames and folders only.** They are always lowercase as well.

I know, this sucks. It's best to stay consistent with lower_snake_case for everything, but the consensus in 2018 is still that [URLs are best parsed using the dash as a word separator](https://www.ecreativeim.com/blog/index.php/2011/03/30/seo-basics-hyphen-or-underscore-for-seo-urls/).
