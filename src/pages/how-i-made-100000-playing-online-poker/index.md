This is the first bit of programming that made money for me.

I started [CrushTheGame.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120105044414/http://crushthegame.com/) and sold my suite of statistics to players around the world.

For poker professionals who would dissect my play with T3o, let me explain. (Poker lingo to follow.)

## Why T3o is a profitable hand in this spot

Obviously if you're raising any two cards first in on the button, you're going to be opening a bit too wide and can be exploited. Most would say you need a slightly more reasonable range, something like 60%â€”which T3o falls out of.

And if you're going to 4-bet, you certainly don't want to be 4-betting any two cards. You'll just be spewing money.

But if you look at my 4-bet after PFR stat, it's higher than average in 100BB 6-max games (around 6%), but not off-the-charts.

This is because I'm not 4-betting 100% of possible card combinations (like T3o suggests), I'm 4-betting 6% of opportunities.

Sometimes I'm folding JJ to a 3-bet.

If the player has a 60BB stack and only 3-bets QQ+ and simply calls the preflop raise with hands like AK and TT, I have to lay down JJ to a reraise.

My statistics gave me that precise information.

I would come in for a 4-bet with any two cards under the following conditions:

* The BB is presented with a squeeze opportunity
* The BB can 3-bet light
* The BB most often folds to a 4-bet
* My 4-bet will be between 10 and 15% of the effective stack (creating "leverage")

These conditions don't occur that frequently. But when they do, it would be a mistake to not take the money.

In the end, the expected value of this play is 78 cents. The expected value of folding is $0.
