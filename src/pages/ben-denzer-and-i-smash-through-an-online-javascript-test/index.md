Recruiters have been sending out links to online coding tests to our circle of developers.

Kick-ass Las Vegas programmer, Ben Denzer, and I talk about coding tests and then power through an average JavaScript coding challenge so you can see what it's like.

My biggest piece of advice in the video is to familiarize yourself with the test before taking it. Watch videos like this one. Go to the third-party test administrator's website and take sample tests. Like in your job, know what is expected of you.

Ben programmed [official-typing-test.com](https://official-typing-test.com/) in his free time. Check it out if you want to improve and test your typing skills.
