An "app" is [generally considered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software) software designed for a user. This could be a mobile app, desktop app, or anything in between.

And virtually every website is now a web application. Most websites interact with users—they have a contact form, a search bar, or an email input to sign up for a mailing list.

Any time you accept user input in your app, you must also offer validation of the user's input. This means you need at least two critical colors for your application: green and red.

##Green means $UCCE$$

In English-language applications, green typically has the following meanings:

- Correct
- Continue
- Success
- Positive

--PICS OF VALIDATION 

Since you don't suck at UX, you are letting the user know when they've successfully completed an action. Which means a "success" or "continue" message, styled with the color green.

##Red means ERROR

In English-language applications, red typically has the following meanings: 
 
 - Incorrect
 - Stop
 - Error
 - Negative
 
--PICS OF VALIDATION 

 Again, since you're not a UX novice, you have big, explicit error messages when the user's input isn't valid. Which means an "incorrect" or "error" message, styled with the color red. 
 
 ##Change the game?
 
 No, don't try to get creative and use other colors in place of green and red.
 
[Jakob's Law of Internet User Experience](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/end-of-web-design/) states:

>Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. — [Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/end-of-web-design/)

This means you should stick with convention. You can use a greenish-tint (like teal) or a reddish-tint (like red-orange or pink) if it fits into your color scheme. But certainly don't show a red success message or green error message. Don't leave a user guessing what a yellow or blue message is supposed to be.

##Brand colors

The first thing an entrepreneur does when they start a business is design a logo.

Though I don't advise it, I can see the psychology behind it. Founders feel like their business is "real" once they have a logo. They may design it themselves, have a friend help them, or pay for something on 99designs or somewhere similar.

Unfortunately, the logo is typically crap. And by the time an application designer comes along, they are stuck working with the terrible colors picked out by the founder's earliest whims.

Not to worry. You can squeeze in their awful color choices and even expand the palette.

If the logo utilizes a red or green hue, use that for the red or green in your palette.

Otherwise, you'll want to pick a red and green that compliments the brand color.

##The 74 colors

You want white, black, and 9 shades of the following 7 hues:

- Blue
- Teal
- Green
- Yellow
- Orange
- Red
- Purple

And 9 shades of grey.

From a usability standpoint, I don't recommend more hues in between these, like violet or indigo. You can make your blue or purple a violet or indigo. But the reason we are using the above 7 hues is because they are most easily distinguishable between each other.

(I'd prefer to remove even orange from the above list, because, depending on the hue, users have trouble telling orange and red apart. But it's used as a "caution" or "warning" status in too many applications, so Jakob's Law applies and it stays.)

Blue is seen as the most benign color internationally, which is why it is used in many web apps.

This is why offering two hues in blue (blue and teal) works well. Remember these are just blueish and teal-ish placeholders. They can be indigo and cyan or whatever works for your brand.
