Imagine you’re a software developer. You get put on a team to redesign a core feature of your company’s application. You spend months collecting user data, prototyping, testing with users (they love it!), and building the application. And today it goes live.

As soon as your feature goes live, phones start ringing, emails start pouring in, and your CEO has to make a public apology. Because everyone hates the redesign.

Imagine hundreds of thousands of people protest the change. They start anti-your-feature webpages. They boycott your product en masse. Time magazine writes an article dissecting your failure.

You’d probably start updating your LinkedIn profile and resume (omitting this fiasco, of course), expecting to get axed as soon as the CEO is done cleaning up your mess.

Now imagine that everyone was wrong. You’d done your research. You’d tested with users (they loved it!). Imagine that, while hundreds of thousands protested, others used the redesigned product and profits soared. Imagine your redesign actually changed the world and how people interacted in it forever.

##It’s a true story

It’s my favorite design story — the story of Facebook’s News Feed. I lived in a college town when Facebook rolled out its News Feed feature in 2006. I could literally hear the students rebelling.

>“Within 24 hours, hundreds of thousands of students nationwide organized themselves to protest the new feature.” — [Time, Sept. 6, 2006](http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1532225,00.html)

People went hard on Facebook. It seemed like everyone was weighing in and 100% of the response was negative.

>“The pattern of events in the Facebook world recently is such that it seems like Mark Zuckerberg is writing a “How To” book about ruining social networking sites.” — typical sentiment from [bloggers in 2006](https://blog.thebrickfactory.com/2006/09/how-to-sabotage-a-social-networking-site/)

Of course, we all know the outcome of this story over a decade later:
